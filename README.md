# TPKbuilder

# Description
This is an encounter builder for tabletop roleplaying games.
When running a game, one of the main challenges is to design fun and enjoyable encounters for your players. This app takes into consideration your players' abilities and comes up with challenges (combat or otherwise) based on a wide number of filters and specifications. I plan on having support for many different systems and rulesets, which users would be able to choose. At first, it will support the Pathfinder RPG ruleset, with D&D 5e being in the backlog.

# How it's going to work
This app will contain databases for players, monsters, traps, terrains, etc. It will have the ability to come up with quick appropriate challenges, either randomly or by the user's specification. Filters will include Challenge Rating, Terrain, Monster Categories and any other ways of differentiating the challenges. I would also like to implement a login system, to save user preferences and give access from multiple devices
